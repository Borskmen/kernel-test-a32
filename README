(Don't worry I'am gonna make a better Readme)
Pls don't blame my English, my first language is French.

Features I know they work :

- SElinux can be permissive

To-do :

- Optimize performance and kernel (CPU gouvernor, I/o shedule, ...)
- Fix MTP on GSI
- Tell me your idea with a issue or on XDA dev (https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/kernel-help-me-build-a-custom-kernel-for-this-messed-up-phone.4526535/)
